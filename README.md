# getNF

## A better way to install NerdFonts

### Dependencies

- curl
- unzip
- fzf

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ronniedroid/getnf.git
cd getnf
./install.sh
```

### Usage

run `getnf` from the terminal and it will represent you with a list of NerdFonts with fzf, select the ones you want, and let it do it's work.

By default the downloaded archives are removed, But if you give `getnf` the `-k` flag, it will not remove the Archives from $HOME/Downloads/NerdFonts

Enjoy
